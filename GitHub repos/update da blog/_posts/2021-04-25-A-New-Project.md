A new project! Check it out!
<!--more-->

So, a new project in a day.

An app runner for Windows!

You wake up, do your work and finally, land yourself in front of your PC. You click the app, and hit Run Apps. Your apps open simultaneously and every app you use will be synced with a save.txt which is very important, do NOT delete it.
