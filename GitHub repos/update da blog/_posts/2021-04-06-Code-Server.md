A new editor in the cloud! Read on!
<!--more-->

So, I have been programming on my laptop, in Google Chrome. Wait a minute, did I just say Google Chrome? Yes, I did, and I introduce you to(drumrolls please!)

Code-Server!

Yes, this is an instance of VS Code, which is my main editor, in a browser. I am running it by deploying it .in Railway.app(you need to get yourself a GitHub account to login, which is fine for me.)

So, I cloned it and deployed it to Railway.app. Then, I wait for 5 minutes and click the green popup.

Remember, when you are setting up, enter a basic password in the Password section to log in and the Git section must contain this:`https://github.com/cdr/docs.git`. 

Then, you go to the site via the green popup in bottom, just click it, and enter your specific password.

There you are! You got yourself VSCode in browser with Bash too!

You can visit the site in any device, but mobile isn't good yet.

Tablets, especially the iPad is advised due to the Smart Keyboard or Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse or Trackpad.

So, that is it for now.
