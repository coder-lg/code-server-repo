Very important announcement, lemme know later in the comments!(I enabled it)

<!--more-->
So, this is VERY,VERY important.


I started a new coding blog.

Yeah, I upload my Jupyter things there, my code on Jupyter(I am still learning) and et cetra.

Till now, I know about these things in Jupyter and they are:
```
Lists
sets
tuples
dictionaries
define command functions
lambdas
class
method
attribute
``` and am still learning.

Visit the blog [here](https://coder-lg.github.io/code-blogs) and read my first one. comments enabled, by the way.
